# vue-social-media
A simple social media homepage, built with Vue.js that displays posts and their corresponding comments. The app fetches data from a mock API and features infinite scrolling, random user avatars, and a "Load More Comments" button. Users' information is displayed next to each post, and their avatars are generated from Picsum.photos.
